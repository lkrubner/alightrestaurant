						Enjoy one of the most unique luxuries in New York: Parlor members never pay for dinner. Complimentary evening meals are a way of life at our club, a special amenity covered by membership dues. Each meal offers a unique opportunity to experience the inspired menu of our executive chef Hilary Ambrose, previously sous chef at Bouley. Members are always welcome to bring guests to dinner.

						Connect with leaders from a variety of professional fields including finance, technology, philanthropy and the arts through our online directory, or through an introduction at a Member Dinner or cocktail hour event. All members are selected from an application pool or referred by the nomination of an existing member, and then vetted through an interview.
