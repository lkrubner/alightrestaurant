<h3>Choose which fields should be mandatory</h3>

<p>If a user fails to fill in a field that you mark as mandatory, their entry won't be created and instead 
they will be prompted to fill out the field. (Note: each time you fill out this form you must fill it out in
full, old values are not remembered from previous visits)</p>

<p><input type="submit" value="Make fields mandatory" /></p>
